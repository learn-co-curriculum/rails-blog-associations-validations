#Objectives:
- Add a column to an existing table via a migration.
- Generate models, views, controllers for User and Tag classes.
- Create associations between Post and Tag via a join table.
- Define proper routes.
- Add validations to your models.

# Rails Blog Associations and Validations

Second lab iteration off of [Rails Blog Scaffold](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/rails-blog-scaffold/tree/master)

<em>Before anything</em>, note that when you generate models, controllers, etc, be sure to include this option, so that it skips tests (which we already have): `--no-test-framework`

## Migrations, Associations, and Routes

1. Change migration for Post to include content (make content text to account for character length).
2. Create migration, model, controller, and views for User and Tag (via rails generate). Check out the documentation on [generators](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Generators.html); you should be skipping adding tests.
3. In order to create the appropriate associations between Post and Tag, we need to create a join table as well.
4. Build out model associations and migrations.
5. Be sure to make the appropriate routes. For now, they can be written as `resources`.
6. `create` the database, `migrate` the schema, and `seed` it.
7. Make the model association tests pass.

## Validations

Active Record has handy methods you can place on columns in a table to validate certain attributes, like presence, length, and uniqueness. These are called in a model. Check out the [documentation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) to see more.

Let's add the following validations on:

1. Posts for the presence of both name and content
2. User for uniqueness of name
3. Tag for uniqueness of name

Active Record handles errors when validations aren't met via user input on our forms. Take a look at what's happening in the partial `_form.html.erb` for users, which was generated when we scaffolded:

```
<%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>
  <% if @user.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this user from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% @user.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
        <li><%= msg %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>
```

1. Build out the forms for creating a new user, post, and tag.

## Adding tags to a post

You've got a great post on kittens that was generated via the seed file, but you want to be able to add some tags. Create a form on the posts form page that lists all the tags as checkboxes, where a user can select multiple tags.

Check out the documentation for the `collection_check_boxes` form helper [here](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-collection_check_boxes) and this post on strong params to be able to make the association between Post and Tag via the Post_Tag join model [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16549382/how-to-permit-an-array-with-strong-parameters).

1. Make the tests in `features/tags_for_posts_spec.rb` pass.
